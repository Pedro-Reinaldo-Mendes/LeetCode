# 258. Add Digits

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/)

## Performance

- **Runtime**: 1 ms (Beats 97.66%)
- **Memory**: 42.26 MB (Beats 97.04%)

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(1)$. We use a mathematical formula to compute the result in constant time, without any loops or recursion.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$. We do not use any extra space.

## Approach

The problem asks us to repeatedly add all digits of a number until the result has only one digit. This is known as calculating the **Digital Root** of a number.

There is a known mathematical pattern for this:
-   If `num == 0`, the digital root is 0.
-   If `num > 0` and `num % 9 == 0`, the digital root is 9.
-   Otherwise, the digital root is `num % 9`.

This can be summarized by the formula: `1 + (num - 1) % 9`, although handling it with conditional checks (or a ternary operator) as implemented is just as efficient and readable.

# 242. Valid Anagram

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)

## Performance

- **Runtime**: 2ms (Beats 99.25%)
- **Memory**: 44.62MB (Beats 52.95%)

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the strings. We iterate through each string exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, since we use a fixed-size array of 26 integers to store character counts (assuming English lowercase letters).

## Approach

The problem asks whether two strings, `s` and `t`, are anagrams of each other. Anagrams contain the same characters with the same frequencies.

1.  **Length Check**: First, we check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are different. If they are, they cannot be anagrams, so we return `false`.
2.  **Frequency Array**: We use an integer array `count` of size 26 to store the frequency of each character in `s`. The index is calculated as `c - 'a'`.
3.  **Count and Verify**:
    -   We iterate through `s` and increment the count for each character.
    -   Then, we iterate through `t`. For each character, we check the current count in the array.
    -   If the count is already 0 before decrementing, it means `t` has more instances of this character than `s` (or `s` didn't have it at all). Since the lengths are equal, this immediately implies they are not anagrams.
    -   We decrement the count.
4.  **Result**: If the loop completes without returning `false`, the strings are anagrams.

 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {

        // If the length of both Strings is different, they're definitely not anagrams
        // of each other
        if (s.length() != t.length())
            return false;

        // The size is 26 because we assume English lowercase letters.
        int[] count = new int[26];

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'a']++;
        }

        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            if (count[c - 'a']-- == 0)
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}

# LeetCode - 1. Two Sum

**Profile:** [PedroRM](https://leetcode.com/u/PedroRM/)

## Performance

- **Runtime:** 2 ms (Beats 99.13%)
- **Memory Usage:** 47.39 MB (Beats 16.46%)

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$
  - We traverse the list containing $n$ elements exactly once. Each lookup in the table costs only $O(1)$ time.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
  - The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash map, which stores at most $n$ elements.

## Logic Description

To solve this problem efficiently, we tackle the need to find two numbers that add up to a specific `target`.

1.  **Data Structure**: We utilize a `HashMap` to store integer values from the array as keys and their corresponding indices as values. This allows for $O(1)$ average time complexity for lookups.

2.  **Single Pass Approach**:
    - We iterate through the array of numbers `nums` exactly once.
    - For each number `nums[i]`, we calculate its **complement**: `complement = target - nums[i]`.
    - We check if this `complement` already exists in our `HashMap`.
        - **If it exists**, it means we have previously encountered the number needed to complete the pair. We immediately return the index of that complement (`hashmap.get(complement)`) and the current index `i`.
        - **If it does not exist**, we add the current number `nums[i]` and its index `i` to the `HashMap` for future reference.

This approach ensures we find the solution in linear time, avoiding the nested loop brute-force method which would take $O(n^2)$.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

/**

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hashmap = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (hashmap.containsKey(target - nums[i]))
                return new int[] { hashmap.get(target - nums[i]), i };
            hashmap.put(nums[i], i);
        }

        return new int[] {};
    }
}

# 20. Valid Parentheses

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

## Performance

- **Runtime**: 2 ms (Beats 97.10%)
- **Memory**: 43.14 MB (Beats 80.35%)

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$, where $N$ is the length of the string. We traverse the string exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$, where $N$ is the length of the string. In the worst case (e.g., "((((("), the stack will store all $N$ characters.

## Approach

The problem asks to determine if a string containing only parentheses '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']' is valid. A string is valid if open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets and in the correct order.

1.  **Stack Data Structure**: We uses a Stack (specifically `ArrayDeque` in Java) to keep track of opening brackets.
2.  **Sentinel Value**: We push a dummy character `.` onto the stack initially. This helps avoid checking for an empty stack inside the loop (if the stack is potentially empty when we try to pop, we get the sentinel instead of an exception or `null`—though `pop()` on empty `ArrayDeque` throws exception, so avoiding empty check is good if logic ensures it). *Correction on code implementation*: The code pushes `.` and pops it at the end. Inside the loop, if we encounter a closing bracket, we pop. If the stack was "empty" (only had `.`), popping gives `.` which matches none of the opening brackets, correctly returning `false`.
3.  **Traversal**: We iterate through each character `c` in the string:
    -   If `c` is a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, `}`), we pop from the stack. If the popped character matches the corresponding opening bracket, we continue. If not (or if we popped the sentinel `.`), the string is invalid, so we return `false`.
    -   If `c` is an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, `{`), we push it onto the stack.
4.  **Final Check**: After the loop, we pop the expected sentinel value `.` from the stack. If the stack is empty after this pop, it means all opening brackets were correctly closed. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets left.
